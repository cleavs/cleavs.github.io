I went past my first milestone which is the intro to ruby development. From a technical point of view I was surprised by how simple and complicated the language is. For instance I read a lot about creating methods and having arguments when you want to let's say iterate over an array. That sounds complicated to a "newbie" like myself but upon further research I was able to do a powerful thing with just one line of code with about 6-7 words.
The TicTacToe project,  simple but complicated. The objective was to create a command line interface (CLI) for the every child's favourite game growing up in the 80's when there was more paper, less internet and the IMF ruled the world. I digress .... coding simple game allowed me to practice methods and iteration but I am yet to figure out how it all comes together eventhough the Object Oriented Ruby was suppose to provide some insight but I can safely say I still don't get it.
The descriptions so far may not be clear but this community is always willing to assist so I had translators ready for explain these objectives. My real challenge is in actual software engineering, while I understand the method and the structure of the programs,  I would love to understand well how do you come up with what needs to be done ? I hope I said that right but how would a developer know that we need validation methods or a winning combination to place in an array and to iterate over it. There is that word "iterate!!!!" According to webster's dictionary to "to run through again"
Have you noticed that I started one way and just go in another direction suddenly? Yeah well that's my journey into learning ruby so far. 
I look forward to that enlightened moment when it will all add up and be confident in my newfound ability. Stay tuned. Maybe next time I will give that suggested topic on github a try or not!!!
