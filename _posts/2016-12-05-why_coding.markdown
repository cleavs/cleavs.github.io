I remember the first time I built a website. I was attending graduate school at Florida State University at the time....go Seminoles !!!! Anyway the assignment was to build a static website using html and add links to the pictures. That was the only time that I thoroughly enjoyed doing homework. Normally I am just trying to beat a deadline or woudl do just enough to pass. This was different,  I wanted to learn so much and was so proud when the professor said it was excellent work even though it was just a static website with a heading, some pics and a paragraph. Hey that was 13 years ago and it was impressive to me :). Since then I have sought to learn by myself but with limited success.
Getting married and having children limited my progress but here I am still willing to properly learn about software development.  The idea of building something that people would want to use or find entertaining ro interesting is such an attraction for me. 
I hope this is the right medium to learn this because I have tried and stopped a few bootcamps, courses etc in my life but I believe it is time to make that career change in 2017 and this is where once and for all I just jump!
